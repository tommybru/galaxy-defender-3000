# GALAXY DEFENDER 3000 - Swift

![Demo](Galaxy-Defender-3000.gif)

## Design Goal: 
Communicating special feature in a way that is intuitive to users and doesn't require instructions: 
 - Clicking further away from the ship makes the bullets travel faster,
 - force fields on the protected asteroids, 
 - and freezing bullets when ship is hit
 
This goal was achieved. Test users immediately understood the blue rings and the light-blue ship symbols (they play into mainstream representations) and users learned how the bullets worked almost instantly.
