## GALAXY DEFENDER 3000 - Swift

![Demo](Galaxy-Defender-3000.gif)

Design Goals: 
- Communicating the special abilities (clicking further away from the ship makes the bullets travel faster, force fields on the protected asteroids, freezing bullets when ship is it) in a way that doesn't require the user to read any instructions, but intuitively understand when they arise.
- To achieve this, I asked peers that tested the game if they understood the blue rings and the light-blue ship that would appear. Because the functionality and the associated UI were based off mainstream representations of space-games, nearly all peers immediately udnerstood the special abilities.
