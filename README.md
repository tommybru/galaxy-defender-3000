# GALAXY DEFENDER 3000 - built with Swift

This game has 3 special features I built to be intuitive and easily learnable. Instruction guides for mini-games can otherwise disrupt a seamless UX.
 1. Clicking further away from the ship makes the bullets travel faster, learned through quick trial and error as every click reinforces this feature 
 2. Force fields on the protected asteroids, learned visually by drawing the well-explored illustration of blue force-field rings
 3. Freezing bullets when ship is hit, learned visually by design of frozen ship and again by trial and error as every click reinforces the inability to shoot
 
I successfully achieved intuitive design. Test users immediately understood the force-field rings and the frozen-ship design, and they learned how the bullets worked almost instantly due to how frequently they clicked to shoot aliens.
